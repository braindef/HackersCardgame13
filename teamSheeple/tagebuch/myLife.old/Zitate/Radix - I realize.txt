If I could gather all the stars
and hold them in my hands,
the colors I would then possess
would not be half as grand
as those which I have seen when I
look deep into your eyes,
or come across when I have kissed
your lips, I realize.

If I could ponder all the truths
men have sought since time began
they would not teach me more than if
I were touch your hand.
For truth, to one whom we have touched,
appears as simple lies
and nothing could be truer than
your touch, I realize.

If I were given lasting life
as only God can do,
I'd shun it all and turn away,
if I could live with you.
For even God has never known
the immeasureable size
of the love that is within
your heart, I realize.
