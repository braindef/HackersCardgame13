Be careful with consuming such content

it looks that if you google or ya.ru "electro porn" that you endup on non-consensual, pedophile and such content, if the women in your herd agree use the query "electro porn lesiban" then you will endup on consensual sweet and with love produced contend, how it should be.

i'm not sure why google / yahoo / ya.ru acts like that

a) women are just better in cleaning up or producing things that are consensual
b) it's suposed to make rapist terrorists out of boys that had wires on their genitals when they were kids, because the would surely query their fetish. it is likely that boys that are good in electronics would have more often this fetish, so the nsa-porn room "crew" want's them as "rapist terrorists"
c) there are bot's that like violence instead of pain, or maybe human bots that have already lost their soul and innocence, maybe we could rescue them, especially when they are equal aged we somehow have to


anyway, if you produce porn only produce consensual porn, where people can see that it is consensual, dont produce ugly, fat, hairy dirty shitty porn, or porn where the male is more than 10 years older than the girl, that's nothing the world needs
