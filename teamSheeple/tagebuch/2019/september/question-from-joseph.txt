Illegally Obtained?
->there are maybe legally obtained "Avatars".

I know from People (male/female) that would produce quite personal data of themselves not for everyone, but for good people. but maybe with some restrictions like:
"only for people that have a good moral"
"only for people that have never (cyber-)killed someone (in the augmented reality)" (but differ self-deffence and murderer)
"only for people that willingly and conscentually clicked on it"
"only for people that are not connected with their own social network
(because such data would be abused, so this restriction would prevent from abuse of such personal data) 
"only for equal aged people"
"only for younger that click consensual and not driven on the Avatar" (under all circumstances never click pedophilia stuff!!!!!!!!)
"never produce/consume material that is/was made non-consensual"
(preferably with an intro and a trailer where you see the people sane and that it was consensual, so to say "kosher") 

Things to also Consider:
-Such things are bad for your Karma
-Such data can ruine your live
-some people used such content to trigger suicide attemtps on me from 2002-2019 (EXPLICITE: https://marclandolt.ch/krankheit/)
-Revenge Porn killed People
-Showing to much of your innerst
 -can be abused against you
  -but if it does not kill you or drives you to suicide it can make you stronger
-if you forget about thet moral i talked above you will end up straigth in hell



That was the good news, now the bad one:

There are people / organisations (ab)using such "Avatar"-Technology [1] as some sort of augmented-reality-simulation, to write or programm stimulus-response-habits [english article: 2] those algorithms you will recognize by the fact that they also use the Amygdalla "function", that causes agression, anger. Eg. Activating Amygadlla Function and Showing an old ugly fat hairy (wo-)man.

These stimulus-response-habits can (ab)used maybe later to do lots of bad things:
-from forcing people to buy trash they dont
-dissociate people slighly to make them subscribe some trash
-blackmail with that what you have clicked
-or more worse things like Breivik or Christchurch.
Maybe you have noticed, many of those people use some sort of symbol language, written on their weapons or their manifests, not all but some. symbols are a stimulus that triggers a response. (Hypnosis)


[1]
 ->maybe coming soon: Elon Musk's Neuralink, but quite sure that Musk is not the first one, i mean Stimoceiver is 1950 technology!!!)
 ->OpenBCI
 ->Hypophysis (good Feelings)
 ->Amygadlla (bad/angry Feelings)
 ->Stimoceiver (~1950)
 ->Cemitrode   (~1950)
 ->Patent US4877027
 ->Neuronexus Implants
 ->but also quite simple things like accoustic or visual stimulus, or interpretation of videos one made.
   Normally normal People can not do such things, it is state of the art technology

Disclamer:
This is not 100% Scientific, so please cross-check this info i just gave you, maybe i placed willingly one or two major mistakes to check if you understood everything and that you not start creating videos like hers that is about 50% true and 50% completely stupid. and yes that for you need to read the wikipedia articles. If you fear to to use Wikipedia please tell me then I will send you screenshots of articles. And yes the fear of using wikipedia is legitimate; read 10: article about Behavioral Sciences (like those above, they can creat also some sort of "Avatar" of you. Not an Avatar about your sexual desires, but one about your education degree (Neocortex), and if they such evil people know from you that you interest in stimulus-response-habits they have lots of "group-policy-obect-templates" (Windows Server Terminology) for this special article that will then attack you or your Neocortex. Making you fear using eg. Wikipedia. The motivation of those people is to keep people as uneducated as possible. (Mind Control) When I started whith those sort of readings this ended up quite bloody [explicite: 9] but now it's a bit better. But WARNING to Quote Chief Wiggum (Simpsons) "gonna get worse before it gets better". If you have friend in your town, one that even studied eg. psychology it would be maybe a good idea to contact him or her, since this sort of people were studying eg. 10 Years these topics.

This specific video is >maybe< a CIA-MKULTRA Honey Pot
 -with her consent
 -whithout her consend, in that case she would be a victim of MKULTRA
 -Psychology-Student that wants to help or something in between
 -"Police has access to this sort of equipmenet" <- i question that
 
she shows you papers with different single topics in a specific order, if you google this it would one definitivly with an unique fingerprint
