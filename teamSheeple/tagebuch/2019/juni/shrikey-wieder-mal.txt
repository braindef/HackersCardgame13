you:  something that "we" decided:

me:  shrikey tends to be imperative for not saying totaliaran, ok maybe not totaliaran. but this is just the way how he hides his insecurities and his low self esteem. he tries to be cool but for me  seems like a desperate attempt to keep the image of the alpha animal intact. he did not realize that the times of those hierarchical structures are long gone. today we have flat hierarchies except in military. so he really should learn to show less disrespect or coolness. there are many ways of showing disrespect to a preson, for example having no time for me (except in some real seldom cases) but having lots of time to secretly and behind my back having lots of discussions with other people in phase. then telling me thins like "we decided" (i can copy you his message if you want, german should be no problem for you) instead of involving me in this 3h discussion as one person that knows the code. it is part of his low self-esteem to tell me "YOU MUST" instead of "what if we would use more regex" (but he didn't said it that way). In some way we do such times also for fun, but sometime both of us do harm. Saying "YOU MUST" feeds his self-esteem; in that way says the mantra "i am the alpha animal" to himself. maybe even without recognizing that consciously. As a Schizophrenic you have tons of such situations in job, but in job you get paid for threaded this way. So if I do that much work for him I guess this is not expected to much. And the thing that right-wing-people often do bad, the first thing when they hear that a collegue has Schizophrenia that the feel satisfied because they think "Hahaha, i'm not the insane one". In other words in their inner/private view they dehumanize the Schizophrenic Person. Since Schizophrenia does not say anything about intelligence there are cases, where Schizophrenic People know things better than others. So how a psyche of such a person reacts if he is outstripped for example in computer science or programming by a schizophrenic?


you:  if he really wants to insult

me:  no he does not want to insult me conscious, but he tends to have revenge since he feels degraded to someone below the value of a Schizophrenic, by hidden kicks with his "foot". Maybe he cannot accept that a Schizphrenic is better than him, at least in Programming, Maths, Linux, OSX, Windows (at least in Server things), Psychology ... ok, it's somehow funny how he tries hard in this topics. thats at least what i've learnd in 20 Years from average right-wing-people in Job. -- maybe he is just ignorant. and to show him how i felt yesterday, i'll write that here so he will feel a little bit bad to. thats called "den spiegel vorhalten" in german. but this is not revenge from my side, this to force him to think about his behavior. i tried to explain him in a fair way and seldom  things "public" but in this situation it seems that this would maybe a way to make him focus more on such things. and i dont hate him, i dont want revenge, i see that he has deficits in those things or as german people say: "Kleine Schläge auf den Hinterkopf fördern das Denkvermögen" -- and of course with his little kicks in my direction like yesterday he (consciousnessly or subconsciously) tries to make me "usable" like a screwdriver, but i'm not a screwdriver, i'm a human. But somehow it's also sad, because he makes himself to a screwdriver too in his job, so he thinks that it is ok to do that with me too but it is not. Maybe he should read "Die Furcht for der Freiheit" by Erich Fromm. Maybe you should read too, but i know you since less than 1 Year so i can not say, but i know shrikey since 25 Years and i know he definitively should read it. but when i tell him such things he always blocks with "i have no time", "that does not intrest me"...


you:  why destroy such thing over this

me:  from my point of view i will not begin to hate him, i can not hate people anyway. i just try to explane him, there is a live besides the ecconomic live / hehavior. and it is a Educational measure for him that i will not give him the source until he changed this behaviors at least against me.


you:  "c++ because i just know the basics"

me:  me too, i know the general concepts of programming and many languages and i also have not much knowledge about c++ since in never made a project with c++, but i will comment more than the cbftp-guy :D


you:  "not always need to ask you for a small modification"

me: that is not the problem, to switch to french: "c'est le ton qui fait le musique", in other words most people can have everything from me, even for free as long as they are friendly and not ignorant. but shrikey is often ignorant and there were times where he left me waiting for weeks. then i complained, then he said he has no time, but meanwhile i know he would have time, everyone has 5 minutes a day to answer questions from the person that works for him for free. so at that point he first ignored me, and secondly he lied to me, and these are things schizophrenics are alergic to, but also normal people.


Conclusion: ok, the "WE DECIDET THAT YOU DO MORE REGEX!" was just a >suggestion< but shrikey used the opportunity to live out his his totalitarian desires, well in that case i will continue there where i stopped yesterday because of this imperial message...


@stalefish: wenn du nur einmal deine verdammten messages zeitnahe beantworten würdest wär das alles nicht nötig (var time -= 1h) in der ich gescheiteres im c++ hätte tun können
@stalefish: ich hab ausserdem vorsätzlich weder deine Familie noch deinen Job erwähnt, obwohl das sehr sachdienlich wäre für das gesammtbild
@stalefish: unterlass bitte in zukunft das "wir haben entschieden", "die anderen sagen".... etc.
