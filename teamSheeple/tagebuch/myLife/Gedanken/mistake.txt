What would be if a so called perfect system did a grave mistake and now someone will gonna die?


The person abused by the system should be declared as psycho, and if possible get a life.
If this person is allready well educated, the system could integrate this person as a surplus.


What if someone allready died?


The system must kill knowing persons asap, even before someone can distribute this knowledge, otherwise the trust(important) into the system dies. Eg. a system with Nuclear Weapons....

the person who claims a perfect world must be nuts or a genius.





THIS REPRESENTS ONLY MY OPINION AND DOES NOT BELONG TO ANY REAL SYSTEM.
