CANON BJC-4000

a Genie post by Maurice Randall via SWRAP, Oct 97


Unlike the BJC-4100, the BJC-4000 does have dip switches and you can use it with your Commodore
easier than you can the 4100. The dip switches are accessible from inside a cover on top of the printer.
There are 13 switches numbered from 1 through 13. The main one is number 11. In the OFF position
the printer is in BI mode and in the ON position it is in Epson mode. Here are the other settings while in
BJ mode: 

     1 OFF=letter width       ON=a4 width
     2 OFF=normal        ON=text scale mode
     3 OFF=11 inch length          ON=12 inch
     4 OFF=character set 1    ON=character set 2
     5,6,7 Set the character code page:
     OFF,OFF,OFF
     OFF,OFF,ON     850
     OFF,ON,OFF     850
     OFF,ON,ON      863
     ON,OFF,OFF     865
     ON,OFF,ON      850
     ON,ON,OFF      850
     ON,ON,ON       850
     8 OFF=no auto linefeeds  ON=linefeeds
     9 OFF=normal        ON=agm mode
     10 OFF=64k buffer        ON=31k plus 41k download buffer
     12 OFF=normal       ON=auto emulation switching mode
     13 OFF=normal       ON=smoothing

Now when you turn switch 11 ON, the printer is in Epson mode and the differences are as follows:

     3 not used
     4 OFF=italics set        ON=graphics set (characters)
     5, 6, 7 international character set:
     OFF,OFF,OFF    USA
     OFF,OFF,ON     UK
     OFF,ON,OFF     Germany
     OFF,ON,ON      France
     ON,OFF,OFF     Denmark
     ON,OFF,ON      Sweden
     ON,ON,OFF      Italy
     ON,ON,ON       Spain
8,9,10 sets the typeface
     OFF,OFF,OFF    Roman
     OFF,OFF,ON     Sans Serif
     OFF,ON,OFF     Draft
     OFF,ON,ON      Courier
     ON,OFF,OFF     Prestige
     ON,OFF,ON      Script
     ON,ON,QFF      Orator
     ON,ON,ON       Orator-S

Changing the positions of the switches only takes effect the next time you turn the printer ON. So, if
you make a change, nothing will happen until you turn the printer OFF and then back ON.   

If you plan to use just text mode such as with Write Stuff, then Epson mode is recommended with
switch 11 ON. Leave all other switches OFF unless you want to change the typeface with 8, 9, and 10.

For programs that print graphics, try BJ mode with AGM turned ON. That would be all switches OFF
except 9. This would help to simulate a 9-pin printer. If you have a printer driver that works with a 24
pin Epson, then use the Epson mode with all switches OFF except 11.   In any mode you might want to
experiment with switch 13 to turn the smoothing function ON. For some graphics that improves the
appearance if the original is a low resolution image. For programs that can print in high resolution such
as geoFAX, leave this turned OFF for best results.     

Also for geoFAX, use the BJ mode with the Canon driver to get the best prints. It is far superior to the
Epson driver.
