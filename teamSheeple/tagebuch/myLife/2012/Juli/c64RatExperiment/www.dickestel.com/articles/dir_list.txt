Creating a Directory Document (C64)

by Dick Estel

You can create a Write Stuff document from the directory of any of your disks, or from a BASIC
program listing.

You could make a disk directory/file catalog, or have a directory in a format that you can easily edit.

For example, I have about 20 articles on disk that might be used in the newsletter at some future time.
They are scattered over four or five different disks. I created a text document from the main disk, then
edited it to remove unwanted information, and to add the names of articles on other disks.

Here are the steps to create a listing or directory document.

1.  WAIT--do not load The Write Stuff yet--the first step is done in BASIC. Insert the disk whose
directory you want to use.

2.  Load the directory in the normal way: LOAD"$",8 [RETURN]
 
3.  Now put the disk on which you want to save your document file in the drive and type (all one one
line):

OPEN2,8,2,"FILENAME,S,W":CMD2:LIST

("FILENAME" is any name you want to give to the document file.)

4.  When the cursor resumes flashing, type CLOSE2.

5.  The same steps can be followed to create a text file of a BASIC program listing by loading the file
name instead of "$". This process creates a sequential file on your disk.

6.  To convert it to normal Write Stuff format, load TWS in the normal way.

7.  Tap [CONTROL] and type l. Backspace to delete the hyphen. Type the name of your file and
press [SHIFT] [RETURN].

8.  You will then see a menu of various word processors. Press  S to select sequential file, and the
program will load and convert your document. You may now edit it and print it as you desire.

A shortened version of these instructions appears on page 46 of TWS manual. A similar process can
be followed with TWS 128 (instructions are on page 47).
