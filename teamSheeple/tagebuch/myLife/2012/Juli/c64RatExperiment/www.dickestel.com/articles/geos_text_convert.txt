Commodore user Mark Murphy of CUCUG, in an article appearing in the September, 1995
Keywords (Commodore Users Group of St. Louis) wrote about trying to convert text files on
LOADSTAR to GEOS format.

He reported that the Text Grabber on GEOS 2.0 64, used with the Generic III word processor
module, worked perfectly. The 128 version of GEOS does not include Generic III.

However, I have found that LOADSTAR text files can be loaded into The Write Stuff as SEQ text files
(page 17 in the C128 manual and page 16 for the C64). A couple of unwanted characters appear at
the top of the file, and can easily be deleted. At this point the text can be saved as a regular Write Stuff
file, which can be converted with the Generic II module in GEOS 128.

An even easier method (which worked in my test) is to use the GEOS program Wrong Is Write to
convert LOADSTAR files directly to geoWrite (use PETASCII as the source). This applies to
Loadstar files having the t. prefix.
