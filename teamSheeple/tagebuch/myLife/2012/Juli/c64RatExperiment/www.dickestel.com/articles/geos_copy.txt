GEOS Copying Tip

By William E. Robblets

If you have files on Drive A that you are going to copy to drive B, instead of dragging the "Multi-File"
to Drive B and clicking, you can copy the files as intended by simply pressing the F2 (shift F1) function
key.

This works if you want to copy a single marked file or several marked files from Drive A to Drive B.

To reverse this and copy from Drive B to Drive A press the F1 function key.

I have tested and used the above tip for copying files only on the regular Desk Top of GEOS  128
version 2.0. No other GEOS versions have been tested as of this writing including C-64 versions.
