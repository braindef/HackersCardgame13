FIRST PC TO SMITHSONIAN

From Associated Press came this bit of data--the Smithsonian museum recently acquired what may be
history's first personal computer.

The G-15, invented for Bendix by Harry D. Huskey, is the size of two refrigerators, and came with the
latest reel-to-reel tape drive and punched paper software--a $50,000 bargain.  Although a bit hefty for
hauling to user group meetings, the G-15 claims PC status because it was the first that could fit into a
normal office and be operated by one person.

And you thought your VIC20 was an antique!
