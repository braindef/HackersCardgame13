A Computer for the 21st Century for Commodore Users:

CMD ANNOUNCES PLANS FOR A NEW COMPUTER 

In an Internet conference held on www.delphi.com/commodore on 10 October 1997,  Doug Cotton of
Creative Micro Designs, released the following information on a new computer that is being developed
by CMD:

The computer will have a compatibility port that will accept a C-64, Apple or other platforms.      It will
have 4 MB of RAM, three 40 MHz 65816 processors,  an SGVA controller, and a soundblaster-
compatible sound chip.   

It will have a new operating system with the multiple processors, so it will be able to perform
multi-tasking and multi-processing.     

It will have a BASIC command line, printer and high speed serial port, on-board hard drive controller
and built-in floppy drive.    

There will probably be an option for a built-in modem and browser/Emai1 software.    

It will also support a CD-rom. They anticipate having a built- in program for word processing as well as
a spread sheet.     

The built-in programs, plus the ability to have local storage, networking, top flight Internet capability,
and other advantages as well, will make it an outstanding home computer.   

Currently they anticipate the machine to cost about $399, but with increased production, the price
could come down to about $299.     

A prototype is expected to be completed within a year and with proper funding, can go into production
almost immediately thereafter.
