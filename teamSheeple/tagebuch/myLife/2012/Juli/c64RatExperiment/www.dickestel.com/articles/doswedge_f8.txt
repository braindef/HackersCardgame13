How to Save Money and Have a DOS Wedge in 128 Mode

A friend of mine told me about a neat trick built into the C-128 Machine Language Monitor, accessed
by pressing F8. Since then, I've been looking for some documentation of it in my books, and have yet
to find it. It's one of the best kept secrets I know of, and I'm going to let the cat out of the bag! 

Using the built-in ML monitor on the 128, you can type "," and follow it with most of the DOS wedge
commands, and it works like a charm to format disks, new a disk, scratch, validate, and rename files.
To get out of the monitor, type X and press [RETURN].

Below are the commands I've tested myself with my 128. You wouldn't want to load and run or save a
file under normal circumstances with this method, but it does make a few things easier. 

128 Mode ML Monitor DOS Commands

,n:diskname,id - Formats a new disk 
,n:diskname - Quick formats a previously formatted disk.    
,$ - Lists disk directory
,s:filename - Scratches a file
,r:newname=oldname - Renames a file on the disk
,v - Validates the disk. 
,I - Initializes the disk in the drive. 
,uj - Resets the disk drive (1571 disk only) 
x:RETURN - Exits the monitor back to BASIC 

128 mode F-Keys: The Cl 28 comes with the F-keys already defined to serve specific functions. 

Fl GRAPHIC          Not a very useful command for general use
F2 DLOAD            Type in the filename and the quote
F3 DIRECTORY        Lists disk directory.
F4 SCNCLR           This clears the screen
F5 DSAVE            Add filename and quote
F6 RUN                   Runs a previously loaded program.
F7 LIST                  Lists a BASIC program or directory, if loaded.
F8 MONITOR          An easy way to use DOS commands.
