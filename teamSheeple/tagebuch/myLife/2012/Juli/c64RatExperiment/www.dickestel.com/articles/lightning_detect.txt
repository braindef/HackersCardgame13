Lightning Detectors 
by Frank Coaricci, Winter Park, FL

Remember this tip during thunderstorm season:  A radio tuned to a clear channel at the low end of the
AM band makes an excellent lightning detector.  You can usually hear the characteristic lightning
crackle on the radio long before you hear the thunder or see the approaching darkness.

When you hear the static, it's a good time to save the program, shut down and unplug.  It's not very
likely that lightning will damage anything, but you're better safe than sorry.

Don't forget the modem - it's a good idea to unplug it from the telephone line.
