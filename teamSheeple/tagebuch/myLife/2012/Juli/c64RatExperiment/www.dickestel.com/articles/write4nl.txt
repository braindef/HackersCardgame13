How to Write an Article for the Newsletter 

by Doug Parsons

Chances are you could write an article for the newsletter that readers would appreciate seeing. After
all, everybody uses the computer in different ways; and everybody is looking for different ways to use
the computer. So, writing about how you use your computer and the knowledge gained therefrom will
have an audience.

As to what to write about exactly, ask yourself some questions. What did you use the computer for
yesterday or today? What are your favorite things to do on the computer? How do you do what you do
on the computer? What new thing did you recently learn? What problem did you recently solve? What
program do you like best and why? What program don't you like and why? What equipment do you
like or dislike and why? And so forth. The answers provide what to write.

As to how to write your article, write it the way you would say it. Write it like you are writing a letter.
Write it so that when you read it, it makes sense to you. And don't worry about spelling, punctuation,
formatting, or length. That is what editors are for.

As for the medium in which to produce the writing, the obvious preference from the editor's standpoint
is unformatted (except for paragraphs) word processing text on a disk. However, not all word
processors can utilize the files produced by other word processors. Therefore, it is best to convert the
text to ASCII and save it as a sequential file. Most word processors can utilize ASCII text files.

In today's communication environment, disks aren't the only way to transmit text to an editor. An article
can be sent to the editor via modem. Text can be uploaded to a BBS accessible by the editor.) Or, if
the editor has an e-mail address, e-mailing an article is as easy as e-mailing any other communication.
