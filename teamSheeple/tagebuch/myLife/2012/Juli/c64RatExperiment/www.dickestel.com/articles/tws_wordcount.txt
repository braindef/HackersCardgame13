THE WRITE STUFF WORD COUNT FEATURE

by Mark R. Miller

The "word count" command counts the number of words in your document and tells you how much of
the available memory you have used and how much is left.  This is very useful in figuring when you are
going to need to break a large document into two or more files.
To use this function:

Press [CTRL] =

At the bottom of the screen will appear a line stating the number of words in the text followed by an
equation subtracting the number of bytes of memory used from the starting total, leaving the number of
bytes of memory left in this text area.  (One byte equals one letter, one space, one punctuation mark,
one return, one formatting command letter, etc.)

If you have not split the text into two separate areas, you will start with 21,759 bytes of memory
available.  This should give you four to five full pages of 80 column text.

If you start run out of memory, end the document at a logical place, save it, then clear memory and
continue your document, and save this next section under a different name.  The names can be very
similar, and have a logical order.  For example, this newsletter was saved in three files, named
"october", "oct two", and "oct three".  (See "File Linking to learn how to "link" these documents
together, so during printing, when you get to the end of one, then next one will automatically be loaded
and the printing continued.)
