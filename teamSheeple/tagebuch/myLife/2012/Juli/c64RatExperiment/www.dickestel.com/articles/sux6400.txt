SUX 6400 / Digimaster Commodore Sound Digitzier

On July 24, 2011, at the Commodore Vegas Expo v7, the Sound Ultimate Xpander 6400 (SUX 6400) and its Digimaster 64 software made their premiere.  Developed after hours and hours of work, the SUX 6400 is a new audio digitizer cartridge produced by the Fresno Commodore User Group and PDXCUG.org.  From Chris Brenner of Autumn Technologies, Digimaster 64 is a re-release of his audio-digitizing and editing program.

The SUX 6400 with Digimaster 64 make up the most sophisticated audio digitizing hardware and software ever made for the Commodore 64 and the Commodore 128 (in C64 mode).  With the SUX 6400 and Digimaster 64, you can capture audio into the Commodore and play back the recording - all in 8-bit sound quality.  You can use the recording in your own programs. Full documentation is included.

The SUX 6400 / Digimaster 64 package has the following:

1. the SUX 6400 audio digitizer
2. a "flippy", two-sided disk with Digimaster 64 software
3. the Digimaster CD disc
4. a quick-start sheet of instructions

Below is Chris Brenner's original description of Digimaster 64.

Digimaster is a unique software product which allows you to process digital audio on your Commodore 64.

This advanced software utilizes a fully graphical interface with pull-down menus.  Incorporated into its operation are many powerful features, such as Cut, Copy, and Paste, which makes editing sound as easy as editing text in a word processor.  Using an optional audio digitizer [like the Sound Ultimate Xpander 6400], live sound can be grabbed into the computer, edited, and then saved to disk.  There is even a utility included which will convert Amiga sound samples, giving you access to a vast library of sounds.

Probably the most impressive feature of this software is its ability to replay sounds in true eight-bit digital audio on your Commodore 64 without the need for extra hardware.  This is made possible by a revolutionary method of controlling the sound chip inside the Commodore 64.  The result is crystal clear audio reproduction.
