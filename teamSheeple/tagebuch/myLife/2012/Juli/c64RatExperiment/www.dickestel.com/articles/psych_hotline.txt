Hello and welcome to Psychiatric Hotline. If you are obsessive compulsive, please press 1 repeatedly.
If you are co-dependent, please ask someone to press 2. If you have multiple personalities, please
press 3,  4, 5 & 6. If you are paranoid-delusional, we know who you are and what you want. Just stay
on the line so we can answer the call. If you are schizophrenic, listen carefully and a little voice will tell
you which number to press. If you are manic depressive, it doesn't matter which number you press. No
one will answer.
