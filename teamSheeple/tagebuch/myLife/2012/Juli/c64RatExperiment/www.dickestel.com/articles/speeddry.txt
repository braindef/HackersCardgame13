A HAIR RAISING TALE (SPEED DRYING)

by Jim Dixon (adapted from CLIPS)

Informed sources at the California Highway Patrol report that many drivers have been detained along
the highways for speeding with "the sole intent of blow drying their hair for a fluffier natural look."

Most of the offenders apprehended had all the windows rolled down, air vents wide open, and several
cans of styling mousse in their possession.  One motorist, when told by a CHP officer that he had been
clocked at a speed in excess of 100 miles per hour, reportedly said, "Yeah, but doesn't my a hair look
good?"

Drivers stopped repeatedly for this offense are severely fined and sentenced to attend Safe
Driving-Safer Grooming classes.  The CHP is currently considering harsher penalties which may include
"shaving some heads!"  Our sources added that the department intends to do whatever it will take to
put an end to this "reckless vanity."
