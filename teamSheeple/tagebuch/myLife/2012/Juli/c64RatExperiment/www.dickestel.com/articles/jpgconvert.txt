JPEG Conversion Comes to Commodore 

JPEG images are a common format for the PC (the letters stand for Joint Photographic Experts Group,
and organization that developed this and other computer file formats). Until recently getting a JPEG
(AKA JPG) file into Commodore format involved at least one intermediate conversion. 

There are at least two programs to do direct JPG to GIF files for the Commodore. One is available
without charge from Gaelyne R. Gasson's web site.

Here are her comments:

This utility will convert .jpg images to .gif format. It is offered with no guarantees.

The file must be available via FTP or the Web, and the converted GIF file is always named "file.gif", so
you'll need to save it with a different name if you intend to convert more than one image.

The utility is rather unforgiving, so if you get a file with zero bytes back, check the URL carefully to
make sure it is correct. Always remember to add the 'slash' at the end of the URL as shown in the
example, and don't forget to check whether the .jpg extension is lower or uppercase (.jpg is not the
same as .JPG).

You can use the example as a test if you like - it's a photo of our home.

Example format:

URL : http://videocam.net.au/images/ 
Filename : house.jpg

To check out this utility, go to http://cbm.videocam.net.au/ then find the JPEG CONVERSION link.
(You can't access it with a graphic browser, it's just for text-based browsers, which of course you will
be using if you are accessing the site with a Commodore.) 

And another note from Gaelyne:

Stephen Judd, the smart guy who now edits C= Hacking has just posted a URL to a web page about a
very new JPEG program for the C=.  It's early days and has a few rough edges, but once again, the
word impossible has been changed to "oh yea, we can do that too."

The URL is:
