Rounding Decimals

I have a need to round off decimal numbers to various places depending upon how they will be used in
the program. Is there a simple way to do it? 

Early in the program write:

1 DEF FNR(N)=INT(N/DP+.5)*DP

DEF defines the function FNR(N) to equal the integer result of N/DP+.5 which is then multiplied by
DP.  The number of decimal places is determined by DP.  DP=.1 gives one place, DP=.01 gives two,
etc. So, in a later program line like:

100 DP=.01: N=DV: V=FNR(N)

where DV=12.176, V would be made 12.18 because 12.176/.01 yields 1217.6 and +.5 makes it
1218.1 which INT truncates to 1218 and then multiplying by .01 yields 12.18. Of course, the value
assigned to N can be held in another numeric variable.
