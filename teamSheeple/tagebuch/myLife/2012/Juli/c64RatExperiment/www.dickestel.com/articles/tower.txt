The Tower Commodore

by Virgil Leisure

A brief explanation about how the tower came to be: I had just purchased The Compression Kit and
found out that it had a dongle, yuk! Always pulling it out and losing it. So I wanted to make a multiple
input switch for the two ports. I ended up making an entire tower. I have been using it for about a year
now, without a hitch. Besides eliminating about half the cables, I now have only one fan cooled power
supply in the tower. I also keep the Ramlink backup battery in it. The tower cost me about $125 to
build and about 1000 hours of effort; well, maybe not that many, but it was a lot of enjoyment and
extremely useful.
