Easy Connector Labels 

by Cecil Serfent - Chesapeake Beach

Like most computers, mine sits on a desk underneath an overhanging shelf, attached to a rat's nest of
wires and cables.  It's hard to see the back panel at all, let alone well enough to plug in another wire. 
So when I need to work with the plugs, it's very hard to locate them.

I've solved the problem by labeling each connector on the TOP surface of my computer, way at the
back, immediately above the connector itself.

Now, when I need to locate the serial bus or some other connector, I know it's right below it's label. 
Once I have it located so precisely, it's easy to replace it by feel alone.
