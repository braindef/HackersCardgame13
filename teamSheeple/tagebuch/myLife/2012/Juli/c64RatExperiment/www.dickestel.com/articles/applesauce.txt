Applesauce

Apple Computers of Cupertino has announced today that they will bring suit against anyone using the
set of characters known as the alphabet as they are of the opinion that the alphabet is covered under
several of Apple's patents issued in 1978. Attorneys for the company refused comment when
questioned on the rumors that Apple was investigating the feasibility of pursuing users of the Arabic
numeral set.  One highly placed Apple source stated that the company would aggressively pursue
infringers of Apple patents, however minor the infraction.
   
In other news today, McDonalds and Apple both filed suit against each other in different venus
regarding the trademark "Mc" and "Mac."  It is McDonald's position that Apple be enjoined from using
the trademark "Mac" as it is too similar to McDonalds own trademark "Mc" and that people may
confuse Apple products with McDonald's products.  Attorneys for McDonalds were especially
concerned with the possibilities inherent in the confusion of McDonald's "BIG MAC" and Apple's
"MAC PLUS." Said one, "Can you imagine  the lawsuit possibilities  if a McDonalds customer were to
break some teeth biting down on a MAC PLUS?"
   
In another court, Apple lawyers moved to prevent McDonalds from using the "Mc" trademark because
it was too similar to Apple's own "Mac" trademark and that customers may confuse the two companies'
products.  Of particular concern to Apple attorneys was the possible confusion between McDonald's
"BIG MAC" and Apple's "MAC PLUS."  Said an attorney for Apple, "Can you imagine the damage
that might be done if a user were to attempt to load a $750 copy of Pagemaker into a BIG MAC?"
   
Both Apple and McDonalds refused comment on the other's lawsuits beyond the regret that ours is
such a litigious society.
