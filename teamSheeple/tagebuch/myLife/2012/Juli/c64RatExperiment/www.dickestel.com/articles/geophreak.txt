How to Tell if You're a geoPHREAK:


You load a work disk with the Note Pad and Note Printer on it to do your grocery list.

You reach for the mouse or icontroller no matter what program you've loaded. 

You have more than 100 fonts.

Your Q-Link bill costs more than GEOS 2.0 and it's all from the GEOS section.

Your hand is permanently cupped into the shape of a mouse.

You load GEOS and use the Desk Top to rearrange the directory of your non-GEOS disks.
