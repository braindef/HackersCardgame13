Eliminating Excess Carriage Returns

If you capture text information from the Internet or via Email, you may find that there is a [RETURN] at
the end of each line. This can cause formatting problems if the text is transferred to a word processor
for printing.

There are several methods to remove the excess [RETURN]'s. The Write Stuff 128 offers an option to
remove them when the text is converted from PET ASCII to TWS format. This works fairly well, but
not perfectly. 

You can also use the Search and Replace feature of TWS or other word processors as long as you
think about what you are doing and take steps to retain desired returns. If you have the need to this,
contact us for detailed instructions.

LOADSTAR LETTER #39 presents several brief programs to accomplish this. A program called
Velveeta (available in public domain libraries) also has this capability. If you have a need to do this,
contact the editor or leave Email and we'll connect you with the program that will serve you best.
