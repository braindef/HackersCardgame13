Ten Computer Safety Tips


1. Use the right chair--look for one with an adjustable seat height and a back that tilts.
2. Sit with your spine against the back of the chair and your shoulders relaxed.
3. Rest your feet on an inclined footrest.
4. Position the screen 18" to 24" from your eyes.
5. Arrange your typing materials at eye level.
6. Keep a straight-wrist position as you type.
7. Use a pad to rest and cushion your wrists.
8. Hit the keys as lightly as possible.
9. Take regular breaks from typing--switch to an activity that uses the hands differently.
10. Do the following stretching exercises before you start to type and throughout the day:
     Make a tight fist and then release, fanning out your fingers. Repeat five times.
     Press your outstretched hand against a firm, flat surface. Hold for five seconds.
     Grasp your fingers and gently bend back the wrist. Hold for five seconds.
