TWS Insert Tip

An article in Commodore World mentioned that text entry slows down when inserting near the top of a
large Write Stuff or Speedscript document.

If you have to insert text near the beginning of a large file (80 blocks or so), you may find that text entry
is so slow it takes nearly a second for a character to show up. A fast typist can easily get ahead of the
keyboard buffer. 

In TWS there is a feature to alleviate this problem. Hold down the [COMMODORE] key and press
[RUN/STOP], and six blank lines will be inserted. Then make sure insert mode is off (press
[CONTROL] i). As you type, new text will be inserted instantly in the blank area. When you finish
inserting, press [CONTROL] [SPACE] to eliminate any remaining blank space.
