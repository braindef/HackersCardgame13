Creating Headers and Footers in The Write Stuff

by Dick Estel

One of our members asked me about placing the following line of information on each page of a
multiple-page document he was creating:

Page 1 of 5

This type of thing is called a header or footer. This involves placing the same information in the same
place on each page. For example, you might have a list that consists of an artist, a song title, and the
location, such as the following:

Artist         Title                         Cassette Number

If you want this to appear on each page, without re-typing it, you create it as a header. Every word
processor has its own methods; these instructions are for The Write Stuff. Although the manual explains
headers and footers, the explanation is a bit unclear, especially as to step by step specifics.

The format is as follows (material in brackets [ ]must appear on the screen in REVERSE type):

[he6;]Artist Title          Cassette Number

The meaning is as follows:

[he] = header
[6] = number of lines from the top of the page (this number must be LESS than the top margin)
[ ; ] = denotes that what follows is formatting codes or text to be printed as typed.

The same format works for footer using a reverse [fo].

If you want your footer to appear centered, or flush right or left, use the first letter of the desired
position. For a flush right header the format is as follows:

[he6;r]My Report

Reverse # will cause a number to appear.

[fo5;c#] would cause the page number to appear five lines from the bottom, centered on the page.

To achieve the results described at the start of the article, Page 1 of 5:

[fo5;Page # of 5]


To have the header appear on the first page, it must be defined at the very top of the document, before
even a [RETURN] is entered. If it is defined anywhere else, it will start on page 2.

For a header or footer of more than one line, place a reverse [BACK ARROW] between the lines.

To have two different footers, for example one on odd-numbered pages and one on even, enter the
odd-page footer, then a reverse colon (:), then the even-page footer.

[fo5;rPage #:lPage # ] will place the page number at the right side of odd-numbered pages and the left
side of even (just like the Write Stuff manual).

You can include formatting codes, such as bold or underline, in your headers and footers. Put the
appropriate codes, in reverse type, AFTER the semi-colon and before the text.

[fo5;ub]Monthly Report will place the words Monthly Report, bold and underlined, at the bottom of
each page.
