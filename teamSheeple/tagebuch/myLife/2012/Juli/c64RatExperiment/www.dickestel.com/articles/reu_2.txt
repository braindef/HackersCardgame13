The REU and ME! 

by Bill Bunch

I have the Commodore 1750 RAM expansion unit (REU) plugged into my user port (where the game
cartridges are plugged in). The RAM in this unit is not directly available to the computer for running
programs but can be used as a very fast temporary storage device. When you turn off the computer
you lose all contents of the REU. Resetting the computer with a reset switch will not erase the contents
of the REU! 

The Commodore 1750 normally holds 512k of memory. I had it upgraded to one megabyte. That is
4,096 blocks. Some people want theirs upgraded to two megabytes, but, there has been talk that the
REC chip might start acting weird and you can lose your files if you overload it,. so I opted to play it
safe and only go for just 1 MB. 

My use of the 1750 REU has been very satisfactory. I am able to use it with my word processor, Fleet
System IV. It can hold the dictionary and the thesaurus. I am able to access them in mere seconds.
Without REU it would take three or four minutes longer. The REU can be used with Novaterm 9.6, a
terminal program. I use it as my buffer. Then when I go offline, I can send all of those files from the
buffer (REU) to the disk drive for more permanent storage. It is not battery-backed, so, it doesn't hold
the files when the power is turned off. I have the Servant installed on a chip in my C128. It will access
an expanded REU of up to 8 MB. It has all kinds of ways to use the REU but that's another story.
