Commodores Still Doing Significant Work

A University of Arizona research astronomer is aboard an aged C-141 jet, soaring 41,000 feet above
Nevada. Sticking out a forward compartment is a 1 meter telescope aimed at a battered piece of rock
called Mercury - 50 million miles away. A Commodore 64, an old computer made originally for
electronic games, controls and fine-tunes data collected from the telescope. Fred Witteneborne, who
directed the operation of the instruments connected to the telescope, says, "It works."

And here's more proof our old standby is still in there pitching: A year or so ago, several members of
RVUG (Rancocoas Valley Users Group, NJ) visited a local radio station and saw the old C-64
controlling several remote transmitters via telephone lines for the station's extended transmitting points.
The station also used a 1541 drive and a 1702 monitor. The station manager wrote all the programs he
uses for control and data input commands.
