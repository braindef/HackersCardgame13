1571 Drive Tip I

by Don Goetham

I've noticed when doing alignment on the 1571 that sometimes the drive is actually not out of alignment
at all. Rather, it appears that the retaining ring which is supposed to hold the disk in place doesn't seat
completely. The result is that disks don't boot and it seems that the drive is out of alignment.

I've tried oil and other lubricants with little success. Here is what I have found to work almost 100% of
the time. After you insert a disk into the 1571 and turn the lever to the closed position, nudge the disk
once or twice. You may hear it "click" into position, or feel it jump into a correct seat. Try this the next
time a piece of software won't boot. If it still doesn't help, then you may indeed need alignment.

Tip II

My 1571 disk drive had a problem formatting a new disk, also saving a file to disk. But it would load
files with no problem! Hmmmmm. In the disk drive, a photosensitive switch paired with an LED light
source indicate whether the disk is write-protected. The signal this setup produces is sent to a chip that
enables the drive's write capabilities. During normal use, a write-protect tab applied to a disk prevents
the LED light from reaching the detector. Then the switch sends a signal that the disk is write-protected,
and the drive won't write to the disk. Without a tab, the disk is write-enabled (you can write to the
disk). 

Failure on the part of the write-protect circuitry will prevent the disk drive from writing to the disk, even
if you are going to format or save. After you attempt a drive operation, a blinking light on the front of
the drive may be a clue that such an error has occurred. A qualified technician can determine whether
your problem is with the LED or the drive's electronic circuit.
