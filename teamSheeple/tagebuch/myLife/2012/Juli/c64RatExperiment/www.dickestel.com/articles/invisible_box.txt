The Invisible Box

by Dick Estel

My favorite geoPublish trick is the use of the "invisible box. It's not something that's needed a lot, but
when it is, it's really handy.

An invisible box can be used to cover up any unwanted information in a bitmap in Page Graphics mode.
For example, say you have created a bitmap with special text that includes the date November 1996.
Now you realize it is December 1996, but you don't want to take time to redo the bitmap. Click on the
box tool, and draw a box over November 1996. Click on the width attribute the reduced the width to -
0-, and select the non-transparent mode, and the box will cover the unwanted material, but be invisible.
You can then enter the desired text on top of everything.

One caveat: A postscript printer will not recognize the invisible box and will print whatever is under it.
I'm not sure what the results would be with a non-postscript laser printer or inkjet, but it is infallible
with a dot matrix printer.

I also use the technique sometimes when I an joining two halves of a wide scanned picture, to cover up
the overlap. You have to use the front to back tool to get everything layered properly, but when done
with care, it does a great job.
