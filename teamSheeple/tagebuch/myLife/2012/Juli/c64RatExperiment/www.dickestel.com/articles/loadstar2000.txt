LOADSTAR Careens Into the 21st Century

Fender and Judi Tucker, sole proprietors of the monthly Commodore disk magazine, LOADSTAR,
have taken solemn vows of poverty and now pledge to continue publishing LOADSTAR at least to the
end of the year 2000.

Having also vowed not to leave subscribers in the lurch with unfulfilled subscriptions, LOADSTAR has
been accepting subscriptions only through December 1999. Now they hope everyone will renew
through December 2000. And as Fender notes, that will be issue 1999, and "who can stop at such a
number?"

The price remains unchanged, $69.95 ($79.95 international). Back issues are just $7.95 each, with free
shipping in the US. Shipping outside the US depends on the size of the order.

LOADSTAR continues to offer monthly billing on a credit card. Call or send Email for the monthly rate.

To subscribe or renew call 1-318-221-8718 (ext 257 or 287); 1-800-594-3370 (orders only), Email
Judi@loadstar.com, or write to P O Box 30008, Shreveport LA 71130-0008.

An editorial comment:

Fender's joke about a vow of poverty is not really that funny. From comments he has made in his
monthly column, it is likely that he is making far less as owner than he did as an employee when
LOADSTAR was owned by Softdisk. Subscriptions have dropped from around 5,000 about two
years ago to under a thousand. It's pretty clear that there's not much profit on a thousand subscriptions
after paying programmers, production costs and mailing. If you're passing around your copy of
LOADSTAR, or receiving a pirated copy, look to your conscience. Are you willing to sell it for six
dollars a month?
