The First Truly Compatible Software

Vapor Soft, Inc. has released Nerd Perfect, the ultimate in vaporware.  The package consists of a
manual and a disk--just the shell, no media.  It's described as using WYGIWYG technology (what you
get is what you get).  And since there's no software, it's the first title ever released that's 100%
compatible with all computers!
   
The manual is written with tongue firmly in cheek; and with a retail price of $9.95, the whole thing
would be a perfect gift for your favorite computer geek.
   
This apparently serious offer is reprinted from Heartland Users Group (Cape Girardeau MO) Town
Cryer, via The Interface, newsletter of Fresno Commodore User Group .  The company's address is
Vapor Soft, Inc., 300 N. Main Street, Suite 15, Fallbrook CA 92028 (619-723-5505). Since this first
appeared ten years ago, would-be customers are advised to write before sending money.
