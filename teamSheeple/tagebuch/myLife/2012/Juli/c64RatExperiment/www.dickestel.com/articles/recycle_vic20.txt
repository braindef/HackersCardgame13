remove the keyboard. Just take care removing the plug that connects it to the motherboard. Use the
same procedure removing the "dead" keyboard from the C64 and swap 'em.

With a soldering iron, you might want the joystick port, the DIN power, serial and video ports, and
chip sockets. I witnessed a C-128 come back to life with an on/off switch carefully removed from
a...Well, by now, I hope you've gotten the point!
