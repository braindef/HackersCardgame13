Safe Disk Mailers

from C.H.U.G. Gazette

It isn't safe to mail a disk unless it has some protection from being folded by an aggressive postal
worker. Commercial mailers are serviceable but expensive and are not always strong enough to
withstand determined folding.

A very rugged mailer can be made from two squares of corrugated cardboard, slightly larger than a
disk.  Line them up so their corrugations are at right angles to each other, then put the disk between
them like the meat in a sandwich.  Tape on all four sides completes a package that is almost impossible
to bend and that's safe in an ordinary envelope.

Another strong mailer can be fashioned from Styrofoam.  Tape your disk (in the sleeve, of course) to
an inch-thick piece, put in an envelope, then dare the mailman to bend it.
