Computer-Mania

(Is This You?)

In the beginning, there was a C-64, a 1541, a black and white TV--and it was good.

In the second month, there were disk magazines and books--and it was better.

In the third month, there was software--and it was great.

In the fourth month, there was BASIC--and it was terrific.

During the fifth, sixth and seventh months there were games, utilities and programming--and it was
excellent.

In the eighth month, there was Fresno Commodore User Group--and it was outstanding.

In the ninth month, there was public domain and a color monitor--and it was fantastic.

In the tenth month, there was a modem, BBS's and the Internet--and it was ultimate!

In the eleventh month there was a Swap Meet, a newsletter and more BBS's--and I never rested!

My family banned the twelfth month!
