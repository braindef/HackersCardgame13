Print Shop Tip: NO FLIPPING!

(This comes from "The Monitor," an incomplete newsletter we had lying around; we think it's from the
Commodore Users Group of Saskatchewan)

When using a Star NX1000c printer with Print Shop, you can use the three block side A graphics if
you set your dip switches 1, 2 and 5 (presumably to ON). If the line spacing is wrong, run this program
before booting up Print Shop:

10 OPEN 4,4
20 PRINT#4,CHR$(27) "1"
30 PRINT#4,CHR$(27) "E"
40 PRINT#4,CHR$(27) "G"
50 CLOSE 4

Note: It's not clear if the final character is line 20 is the letter l or the number 1; try it both ways and let
us know.
