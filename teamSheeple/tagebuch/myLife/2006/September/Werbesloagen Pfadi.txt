imagin, you are young and with thousend of other scout in the same camp,
you can do whatever you wanna do, ok you dont have a television or even a 
radio but you have tools and the permission to build everything you can with 
that tools, in the evering you sit arround a warm fire and sing songs like a 
really great family and even if some people write their title songs about this 
camp, you cant imagin, it the real live, ok if you get older you grow out of this 
dream but it was the best time ever. and it does not really need much resurce, you 
need some people that know scout live, that can sing and can leed the young people 
even those that barefaced, ok what would the world be without some of them...
