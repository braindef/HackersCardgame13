all the breath and the bloom of the year
in the bag of one bee

all the wonder and wealth of the mine
in the heart of one gem

in the core of one pearl all the shade
and the shine of the sea

breath and bloom, shade and shine
wonder, wealth and how far above them

truth that's brighter than gem
truth that's purer than pearl

brightest truth.
purest trust in the universe
all were for me
