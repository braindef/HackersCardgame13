(13:07:18) landev: also de kurz het au mol no mit vista probiert und es goht definitif ned....
(13:07:37) Dominik: uf min server ?
(13:07:39) landev: jo
(13:07:53) Dominik: und wo isch s problem ? :-)
(13:08:38) landev: i dänke am ipv6 und a euchem router...
(13:08:56) landev: i sueche mol no chli, weisch du grad was ihr för en router händ am server?
(13:12:31) landev: Changes in PMTU Black Hole Router Detection Path maximum transmission unit (PMTU) discovery, defined in RFC 1191, relies  on the receipt of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) Destination  Unreachable-Fragmentation Needed and Don’t Fragment (DF) Set messages from  routers containing the MTU of the nexts are known as black hole PMTU routers. Additionally,  intermediate routers might drop ICMP messages because of configured packet  filtering rules. The result is that TCP connections can time out and terminate  because intermediate routers silently discard large TCP segments, their  retransmissions, and the ICMP error messages for PMTU discovery. PMTU black hole router detection senses when large TCP segments are being  retransmitted and automatically adjusts the PMTU for the connection, rather than  relying on the receipt of the ICMP Destination Unreachable-Fragmentation Needed  and DF Set messages. With TCP/IP in Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP, PMTU  black hole router detection is disabled by default because enabling it often  yielded false positive results, lowering the MTU unnecessarily and decreasing  performance. With increasing use of packet filtering rules on routers to drop ICMP  traffic, the Next Generation TCP/IP stack enables PMTU black hole router  detection by default to prevent TCP connections from terminating and uses an  improved method of detecting PMTU black home routers. PMTU black hole router  detection is triggered on a TCP connection when it begins retransmitting  full-sized segments with the DF flag set. TCP resets the PMTU for the connection  to 536 bytes and retransmits its segments with the DF flag cleared. This  maintains the TCP connection, although at a possibly lower PMTU size than  actually exists for the connection. This behavior also applies to IPv6 traffic. For IPv6, the PMTU is set to 1220  bytes if a PMTU black hole router is detected.
