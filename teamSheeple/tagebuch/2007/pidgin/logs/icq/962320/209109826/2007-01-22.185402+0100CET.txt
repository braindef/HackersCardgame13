(18::55::28) landev: btw, are there any important mathematicians from russia?
(18::56::53) dikyangel: economists more important
(19::00::23) landev: for the ecconomy, yes, but not for a technician like me, in switzerland we have a lot of economists, they do their job and since 66% of the national income is form banks they seem to do a quite good job. but mathematics is more interesting, at least for me...
(19::00::33) landev: arent there any?
(19::02::33) dikyangel: Its not rentabel in Russia
(19::04::33) landev: ok mathematics is never lucrative, except you are a professor at a university, but this does not mean that it is not important, i like it more than crossword puzzles...
(19::07::11) landev: wherent there Grigori Yakovlevich Perelman which solved the Poincar√© conjecture last year?
(19::08::49) dikyangel: Its difficult understand

(19::21::12) landev: sometimes i wonder why man are more interested in some stupide smylies than in real important mathematic problems (i mean me)
(19::22::39) dikyangel: Do you really interested?
