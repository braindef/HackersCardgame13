(18:43:33) dikyangel: What is the language?
(18:45:32) landev: http://www.louannbrizendine.com/ the female brain... it is about the behaviour of women... written by a woman that makes always jokes about mans, sepecially her husbend... but in fact its a very good book about what goes on with man and woman and how the hormones let us do what we do...
(18:47:43) dikyangel: Why does she make jokes about men?
(18:53:42) landev: because, from her point of view most man are led by testosterone, we want to show that every one of us ist the strongest and we (the mans) think all the time about sex, in fact there where i work are a lot of mans that really seem to think all day about sex, and even talk about it... but if you want to talk about psychology or more worse about feelings with one of they seem to fell week... and go back to work... 
(18:57:40) dikyangel: All men are week  in sex and that is why they try to find themselves in work?
(19:03:39) landev: i guess this is wrong, it also dependes on the mood of the women how good the sex is, if she feels uncomfortable or has some stress or something else there the amygdala does not let her have good sex, this is because from the stoneage if you have sex with a man that is not perfect and in a situation taht is not perfect the child will not be perfect, but women are programmed to select the best genes for her kids, so the menkind does develop, whitch seems to be a god chess move from the nature for improofing their species. but if you are interested in good sex you can disable the bad bahaviour of the amygdala (part of the brain) with taking valium, thats at least what she writes... but what normal person is only interested in having sex with someone else...
