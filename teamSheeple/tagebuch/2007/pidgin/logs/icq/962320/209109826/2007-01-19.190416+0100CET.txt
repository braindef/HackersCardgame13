(19::05::02) landev: btw, how does the russian ecconomy goes? have they adopted well the change from communist to capitalist?
(19::07::08) dikyangel: i was a little girl and didnt felt communism
(19::09::16) landev: but what i mean, in communist systems everybody gets a job from the state and in capitalist systems everybody must look that he gets a job, my question is, have you a lot of unemployed people or is your ecconomy growing since it was a "vacuum" on consume goods?
(19::13::30) dikyangel: its very difficult to find a good job . If you dont have education and especially experiance its  almost impossible
(19::14::23) landev: and does the state do something to improove this situation?
(19::16::47) dikyangel: i would say, nothing.  a lot of unenployment people
(19::17::45) dikyangel: my spelling is:'(
(19::18::02) landev: i have no problem to understand you...

(19::22::25) dikyangel: of course many businessmen and wealthy people. the problem is how to collect money to start your own business
(19::22::44) landev: ok in switzerland you have the same problem...
