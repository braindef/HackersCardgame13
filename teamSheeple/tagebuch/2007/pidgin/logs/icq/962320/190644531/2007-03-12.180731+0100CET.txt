(18:09:16) vortex: and about the book!! are you trying to make fun of me!
(18:10:22) vortex: :( no one ever knows how the woman's brain works!! - in case they found a "mind" in the first place- you see there is a brain, which stands for the physical material!! but "mind" is the abstrat thing!!
(18:10:25) vortex: :)
(18:11:09) landev: no, i first thought that must be a book where man are described as poor hormone-driven things only having sex in the head, an the first part is exactly what i expected, but in the secand part it is quite interesting, what hormones drive us doing what and so on ... i find it interesting....
(18:11:13) vortex: and i don;t think that i have a previaldge of the "mind" i might have a brain but..... hmmmmmm....  a brain too!! that will be too much for me to have!!!
(18:12:02) vortex: :) yes i know:D
(18:12:46) vortex: and no one can speculates women's behaviours because they have a lot of unstability in harmons!!
(18:13:21) vortex: the first week the second one the third one and then the fourth, and you have to repert that over and over again!
(18:13:24) landev: this is at least what is written in the book, but some behaviour can be told about woman:
(18:13:48) vortex: !! yes as long as you know how much harmons they have!!
(18:14:30) landev: they have a twice as big part for social interaction, so thats the reason why woman talk all the time... 
(18:14:33) landev: hehe...
