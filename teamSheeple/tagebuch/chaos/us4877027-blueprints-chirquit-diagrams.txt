I have a question to you:

I really try to find some undeniable evidence for such technology like eg. the Patent US4777027 (Microwave Hearing) and I found your Website but did not find anything like the Cirquit Diagram of such Technology.

My Idea (i'm quite gifted in Electronics and Computer Science) is to build such Technology by my own to proove that it is possible to build such devices. So I really would love to finde some Cirquit Diagrams, but I found none on the WEB.

So i was thinking, that you as an expert maybe have such documents?

With Kind Regards
