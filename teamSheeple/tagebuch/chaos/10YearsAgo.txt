what to fight for in this live
just for the system keep alive

long long time we intertwine
hoping that it was not in vain

so i fought so many fights
praying to get my rights

but found out that god does not fight
but leading me with his light

and ten long years ago
sent by you to "ghetto"

but then i realized
it's required to polarize

have you seen just only twice
hoping to see again your face

i think of you near every night
images of you in a flashlight

pleasing god for a real live
because real love is not transitive
