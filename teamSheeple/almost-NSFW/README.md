## Consumer note

Use Cases:

☑ share good ideas without real NSFW Content consensual

☒ share bad ideas without real NSFW Content or nonconsensual

☒ share link to real NSFW Content to "motivate" kids to go there


since it is likely that in childhood more base content is stored it would also be important to have a look at the sanitiy of such content. Even if it is not illegal someone should have a look that consensual content is being created and distributed. maybe you have noticed we did not take any pictures from google that shows "baby mlp's" because this would suggest maybe pedophilia. if you do a google image search "mlp porn" there is unfortunately quite a lot bad content.

eg. "ABDL MLP" Content seems to be more baby fetish than diaper fetish. Diaper Fetish is in my opinion acceptable as long as it is consensual with one true equal aged partner, baby fetish is not.

Another problem could be that google intentionally shows such MLP content to "motivate" the kids to consume porn, even when the kid just searched for a normal MLP image.

I'm not aware of a situation where the submissive part could be a problem. *MISTRESS: DeepPacketInjection: well you need to care that he or she does not run suicide or amok, m32 or worse for example if you would not know that your slave is autistic and that many autistic people suffer from isolation and therefore would not survive if you would break the promise to be true forever*


things like 47a.jpg: if at all, please only vegetarian stuff, otherwise you will maybe hate you the rest of your life for that and also really really dislike BBQ's... at least this sort we have here in switzerland with Cervelat (Sausage)

unknown: update:

Sufficient to inject a "selektoren kombination" eg over us4877027 to the kids room, then one could steer the kid into the wrong direction, maybe we should mitigate that or at least create a database with concept knowledge that we can help the victims to find the way back.

wie z.B. der Ckaude das Wort "bondage" angefüttert hat ca 1999...


Male Autistic Ponies would also say "M O R E" to consensual PAIN but only if

- Situation is save (eg. no older People stalking (eg. Daniel Suarez: D-Raum on DBS)
in case of autistic persons that are gifted in Computer Science it's an additional problem since Satan would like to possess all autistic ponies because they are gifted
- Trust into his equal aged mistress Pony (Satan intentionally tries to destroys this trust)
- autistic people look at eg. social media as some sort of part of their body, so this part of the body must be cleand first. Unfortunately it’s a “Füllhorn”

Herleitung:
Autistic people tend to find bugs, as early as by the age of 6 years. In German one would say Fehlersuche (autistic person) and the others do "Fehlersuche" (NT's)

NT: Non AuTistic Person

Fehlersuche is intentionally or accidentionally search/find Bugs to report and fix them, often paired with outspoken thoughts like "STUPID Nts"

This normally leads to the circumstance that the NTs begin with "Fehlersuche" too, in "quotes" because the NTs try to find Bugs in the Argumentation of the Autistic Person (autistic people are some sort of an enhanced PROLOG programming language). If the NTs fail with eg. logical things, they feel bad, especially if the autistic person is eg. 6 Years old and try to inject mistakes into the PROLOG code of the autistic pony to make the autistic pony "DO WHAT I SAY" (Clawfinger) because “you little pony are wrong and we older parents are right, hahaha”

Again German:
"Negation von Qualität, Logik und Mathematik ist Selstbeschädigung"


People tend to say:
Male Ponies don't like PAIN, and in case of psychological pain this is maybe true. When Parents get angry because of enhanced PROLOG Function of Autistic People they often use violence against autistic ponies. Autistic People differ [1] between PAIN (that is consensual with equal aged) and VIOLENCE (that is non-consensual and mostly from the parental generation). Swiss law does not allow Pornography Content with "Gewalt" (de-de: Violence) but if it’s consensual pain it seems to be allowed.

But back to the main topic: if one would look at MLPs as some sort of Carl Gustav Jung “Archetypes” each Pony would be an archetype, theoretically. But in my case i’m some sort of double MLP archetype. If i feel save i behave like Pinkie Pie, and if they use violence against me i tend to behave like Fluttershy. My Shrink diagnosed “Schizophrenia” but i think that this diagnosis is a Bug. 

Differential-Diagnose: Autism ↔ Schizophrenia


[1] Prolog Details: I don’t look at a “red tree” and a “yellow tree” as of the same object with a different color attribute. In my worldview red and yellow trees are some thing completely different
