## Consumer note

Use Cases:

☑ share good ideas without real NSFW Content consensual

☒ share bad ideas without real NSFW Content or nonconsensual

☒ share link to real NSFW Content to "motivate" kids to go there

since it is likely that in childhood more base content is stored it would also be important to have a look at the sanitiy of such content. Even if it is not illegal someone should have a look that consensual content is being created and distributed. maybe you have noticed we did not take any pictures from google that shows "baby mlp's" because this would suggest maybe pedophilia. if you do a google image search "mlp porn" there is unfortunately quite a lot bad content.

ge. "ABDL MLP" Content seems to be more baby fetish than diaper fetish. Diaper Fetish is in my opinion acceptable as long as it is consensual with one true equal aged partner, baby fetish is not.

Another problem could be that google intentionally shows such MLP content to "motivate" the kids to consume porn, even when the kid just searched for a normal MLP image.

I'm not aware of a situation where the submissive part could be a problem. *MISTRESS: DeepPacketInjection: well you need to care that he or she does not run suicide or amok, m32 or worse for example if you would not know that your slave is autistic and that many autistic people suffer from isolation and therefore would not survive if you would break the promise to be true forever*


things like 47a.jpg: if at all, please only vegetarian stuff, otherwise you will maybe hate you the rest of your life for that and also really really dislike BBQ's... at least this sort we have here in switzerland with Cervelat (Sausage)
